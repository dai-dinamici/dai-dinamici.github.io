Title: Dynamics of the visual system

Abstract:
The overall theme of this talk is that the brain is a large and very complicated dynamical system about which we have only limited knowledge, and a challenge for dynamicists is to understand the neural basis, or dynamical mechanisms, for various brain functions.  There are many types of brain functions: sensory, cognitive, motor-related...  Sensory problems are especially amenable to bio-mathematical analysis, because one can directly measure the cortical responses to sensory inputs.

Title:  Coarse-grained modeling of the primary visual cortex

Abstract:
This talk focuses on coarse-grained (CG) modeling of cortical dynamics.  CG models, by working with averaged quantities like firing rates, are easier to tune, run, and analyze, and greatly reduce the cost of modeling (measured in both human and computer time).  But averaging inevitably means certain intrinsic features of neuronal networks -- especially their structural and dynamic variability -- are lost, and a priori it is unclear to what degree one can expect CG models to capture neuronal network dynamics.  Here we propose a multiscale CG strategy inspired by ideas from nonequilibrium statistical mechanics.  Our simulations show that this strategy can faithfully capture the response of the primary visual cortex to external stimuli.

NOTE: The seminars will be streamed live on our YouTube channel then saved there. If you ask questions, with your video feed on or off, you agree to the use of your image/spoken words for said purpose.
