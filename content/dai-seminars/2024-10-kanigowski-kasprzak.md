Speaker: Adam Kanigowski (University of Maryland),

Title: Ergodic Theorems along sparse subsets of the integers

Abstract: Let A be a subset of the positive integers. For a dynamical system $(X,T)$ we are interested in ergodic averages along $A$, i.e. for $x\in X$ and $f\in C(X)$ we look at the limiting behavior of $\frac{1}{|A_N|}\sum_{k\in A_N}f(T^kx)$, where $A_N=\\{ k\in A: k\leq N \\}$.
We will focus on the case where $A$ is the set of primes or values of polynomials with integer coefficients. We will recall some classical results, mention some recent developments and highlight some interesting open problems.

Speaker: Kosma Kasprzak (Jagiellonian University, Krakow) 

Title: Ergodicity along square orbits in rigid dynamical systems

Abstract: In this talk we will focus on topological dynamical systems exhibiting rigidity; that is, systems $(X, T)$ where some sequence of iterates $T^{q_n}$ approaches the identity function on $X$. It turns out, that a variant of this property gives us control over the ergodic averages along squares for any starting point $x\in X$. We will showcase this original result, discuss its proof and provide a class of examples of systems satisfying the assumptions.

NOTE: The seminars will be streamed live on our YouTube channel then saved there. If you ask questions, with your video feed on or off, you agree to the use of your image/spoken words for said purpose.
