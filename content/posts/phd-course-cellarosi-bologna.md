Program

The course will focus on recent advances concerning the study of random behaviour of number-theoretical 
sequences. We will mainly focus on the distribution of square-free integers and their generalisations 
(e.g. k-free, B-free). We will discuss Sarnak's conjecture on the disjointness of the Mobius function mu(n) 
from sequences generated by zero-entropy dynamical systems. We will prove that mu^2(n) (the indicator of 
square-free integers) is completely deterministic and study the statistics of its patterns in long intervals. 
We will also discuss some very recent progress on the distribution of square-free integers in small intervals.

Time permitting, we may discuss the limiting distribution of quadratic Weyl sums and their generalisations 
(e.g. classical Jacobi theta functions). Quadratic Weyl sums are a special kind of exponential sums that 
appear naturally in number theory, mathematical physics, and representation theory. They can be interpreted as 
deterministic walks (with a random `seed') in the complex plane. Generalising Sarnak's equidistribution of 
horocycles under the action of the geodesic ow, we can study the limiting distribution of such Weyl sums. A 
stochastic process of number-theoretical origin can be defined using such sums. Understanding the behaviour of 
trajectories of the geodesic ow in a homogeneous space, we can study this process, that shares only some of 
its properties with those of the Brownian motion.
