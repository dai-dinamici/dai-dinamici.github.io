title = "Research Fellow position on Coupled Quantum-Classical Dynamics at Surrey"
+++

The Mathematics Department at the University of Surrey (UK) is
advertising a full-time Research Fellow position on Coupled
Quantum-Classical Dynamics.

High quality candidates from Applied Mathematics or Theoretical Physics
(or related areas) with familiarity with numerical methods and a solid
background in quantum and classical mechanics are particularly sought.

At the basis of measurement theory, the interaction of classical and
quantum degrees of freedom has attracted much attention in several other
fields, ranging from mathematics to physics and chemistry. Different
levels of scientific capabilities will be engaged: on the one hand, the
Fellow will investigate the mathematical features of QC coupling in both
reversible and irreversible regimes; on the other hand, they will
perform numerical simulations to study decoherence dynamics and other
physical effects of QC correlations.

This position is for 2.5 years, starting at any point between 1 December
2021 and 1 March 2022. For an informal discussion about the role, please
contact [Dr Cesare
Tronci](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/people/cesare-tronci) via email at
[c.tronci@surrey.ac.uk](c.tronci@surrey.ac.uk).

In addition to salary, the successful candidate will receive a generous
annual leave entitlement and excellent development opportunities.  The
University of Surrey offers benefits packages which include pension,
childcare assistance and leisure facilities.

**Deadline for application:** 6 October 2021
