The conference **On Geometric Complexity of Julia Sets - VI** will be held at the [Stefan Banach International Mathematical Center](https://www.impan.pl/en/activities/banach-center), BÄ™dlewo, Poland, on *August 3 - 8, 2025*. It will address a wide range of topics on Complex Dynamics, many of which related to the question of how complex Julia sets can be.

While the organizers hope that most participants and speakers can attend in person, there will be the option to attend virtually. More information can be found on the conference website:
