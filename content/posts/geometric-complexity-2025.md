This is an announcement for the **"On Geometric Complexity of Julia Sets - VI"** conference to be held at the Stefan Banach International Mathematical Center,
BÄ™dlewo, Poland, on *August 3 - August 8, 2025*. 
This conference will address a wide range of topics on Complex Dynamics, many of them related to the question of how complex Julia sets can be.

The organizers hope that most participants and speakers can attend the conference in person, there will be the option to attend virtually.
