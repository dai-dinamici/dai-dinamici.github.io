A 18-month postdoc position *(assegno di ricerca)* is available at the 
Department of Mathematics "Tullio Levi-Civita" of the University of Padova, 
within the PRIN project *"Stability in Hamiltonian Dynamics and
Beyond"*.

The postdoc will work on the topics of the project, particularly on:
Hamiltonian and non Hamiltonian (e.g., nonholonomic, conformally
symplectic, almost-symplectic) systems, including integrability and
(extensions of) KAM and Nekhoroshev theories. Billiards and
billiard-like systems, including their connection with symplectic
topology. Dynamics and stability properties of Hamiltonian dynamical
systems with singular potentials, including vortices. Convergence to
attractors in dissipative systems.

The research will be in collaboration with the members of the Padova
unit (O. Bernardi, L. Baracco, F. Fassò, L. Garcìa-Naranjo, N.
Sansonetto) and of the entire PRIN project. The ideal candidates will have a
good basic knowledge in Hamiltonian mechanics and dynamical systems, and
expertise in some of these techniques.

**Deadline for application:** Friday, January 19, 2024, 1pm Italian time 
*(via the platform PICA)*
