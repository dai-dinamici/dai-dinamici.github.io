A 18 month postdoc position ("assegno di ricerca") is available at the 
Department of Mathematics "Tullio Levi-Civita" of the University of Padova, within the PRIN project *"Stability in Hamiltonian Dynamics and
Beyond"*.

The postdoc will work on the topics of the project, particularly on:
Hamiltonian and non Hamiltonian (e.g. nonholonomic, conformally
symplectic, almost-symplectic) systems, including integrability and
(extensions of) KAM and Nekhoroshev theories. Billiards and
billiard-like systems, including their connection with symplectic
topology. Dynamics and stability properties of Hamiltonian dynamical
systems with singular potentials, including vortices. Convergence to
attractors in dissipative systems.

The ideal candidate will have a good basic knowledge in Hamiltonian
mechanics and dynamical systems, and expertise in some of these techniques.

The research will be in collaboration with the members of the Padova
unit (O. Bernardi, L. Baracco, F. Fassò, L. Garcìa-Naranjo, N.
Sansonetto) and of the PRIN project.The ideal candidates will have a
good basic knowledge in Hamiltonian mechanics and dynamical systems, and
expertise in some of these techniques.

**Applications must be submitted by 1pm italian time of Friday, January
19, 2024**, via the platform PICA. All instructions are available on the
[official "Albo online"](https://www.unipd.it/albo-on-line) of the University of Padova 
and at [this link](https://www.math.unipd.it/news/bando-n-22-2023-per-n-1-assegno-di-ricerca-stabilita-in-sistemi-hamiltoniani-e-oltre/).

For information feel free to contact [Prof. Francesco Fassò](fasso@math.unipd.it).

Please feel free to share this information with potentially interested
candidates.
