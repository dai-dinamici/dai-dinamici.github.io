Two DinAmicI are among the organizers of the workshop 
**[Computer-verified proofs: 48 hours in Rome](https://www.mat.uniroma2.it/butterley/formalisation/)**, 
to be held at the Department of Mathematics of University of Rome Tor Vergata on **24-26 January 2024**.

**Website**: <https://www.mat.uniroma2.it/butterley/formalisation/>

The workshop concerns interactive proof assistants, programs that allow one to write and verify 
mathematical proofs. As such, the focus on the Lean 4 language and its mathematical library.

For those who want an overview, several talks will be presented on major aspects of this emerging 
field. For those who want to go deeper, a series of workshop-style sessions will be offered, 
intended to give participants first-hand knowledge. The aim is to provide an introduction to this 
area for working mathematicians and advanced students in a variety of fields.

Participants are kindly asked to [register](https://forms.gle/ePWKBwz5y7qMXt2GA).
