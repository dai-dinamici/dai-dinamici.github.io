The *2026 General Meeting of European Women in Mathematics* will take place from 
**31 August to 4 September 2026** at the University of Warwick (UK). Save the date!

In addition to colloquium-style plenary talks and other activities, the programme 
will also include parallel sessions of more specialized minisymposia. This announcement
is also a call for mini-symposia. Minisymposia should consist of six talks of twenty 
minutes each. To propose a minisymposium, send a brief (1-2 pages) pdf with a brief 
discussion of the area, and your proposed speakers to 
<EWM2026GeneralMeeting@europeanwomeninmaths.org>. A majority of your speakers and 
organisers should identify as women.  

The **deadline for mini-symposium proposals** is Monday 1 December 2025.
