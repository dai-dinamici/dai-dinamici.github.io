The Women in Math Committee (WiM) of the European Mathematical Society is
organising an event called "EMS/WiM Day" within the initiative of "May 12th", a
celebration of women in Mathematics in memory of Maryam Mirzakhani.

The event consists of scientific talks (at the level of a Colloquium talk) of
two distinguished speakers, which will take place online on **Friday, 20 May 2022**
with the following schedule:

- 14:45 CEST      Welcome
- 15:00 CEST      Tara Brendle (Glasgow University, UK)
- 16:00 CEST      Tere M. Seara (UPC, Barcelona, Spain)


The titles and abstracts of the talks are given below.

Any interested person may attend via
[Zoom](https://videoconf-colibri.zoom.us/j/84640950186?pwd=VFZHSitFTVZxNHc2ckE2Y2pHK0NoUT09)
(passcode 216273).
Please, forward the information to your contacts, and circulate it as widely as
possible.

Best wishes from the EMS/WiM Committee,

Shiri Artstein, Alessandra Celletti, Maria del Mar Gonzalez, Mikaela Iacobelli,
Stanislava Kanas, Marjeta Kramar Fijavz, Isabel Labouriau, Pablo Mira, Jiri

## Titles and abstracts

- **Tara Brendle** (Glasgow University, UK): _Symmetries of manifolds_

  Abstract: Riemann introduced manifolds in the mid-19th century as a mechanism
  for understanding n-dimensional space.  Landmark achievements in mathematics
  since then include the classification of 2-manifolds in the early 20th century
  as well as the more recent (though more complicated) classification of
  3-manifolds completed by Perelman.  However, the story does not end with
  classification: there is a rich theory of symmetries of manifolds, encoded in
  their mapping class groups. In this talk we will explore some aspects of mapping
  class groups in dimensions 2 and 3, with a focus on  illustrative examples.


- **Tere M. Seara** (UPC, Barcelona, Spain) _Arnold diffusion: an overview and recent results_

  Abstract: In this talk I will talk about the phenomenon known as Arnold
  diffusion. Equivalently we will show the mechanism that creates big effects
  after applying arbitrarily small forces for a sufficiently large time. In the
  language of Hamiltonian Systems, we will consider small periodic in time
  perturbations of an integrable system. It is known that the energy is preserved
  in an integrable system, as well as other quantities known as actions. We will
  show that an arbitrarily small perturbation can create big increments in the
  energy (and in the actions) and we will explore the dynamic mechanism that is
  behind this phenomenon.
