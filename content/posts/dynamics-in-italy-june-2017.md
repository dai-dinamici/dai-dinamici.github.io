School on Hyperbolic Dynamics - Centro di Ricerca Matematica Ennio de
Giorgi - Pisa

This is an advanced school on hyperbolic dynamics and related topics.
Subjects include SRB measures, non-uniformly hyperbolic diffeomorphisms,
statistical properties, Young towers, coupling arguments.

The school will feature four minicourses, given by:

• Dmitry Dolgopyat (University of Maryland)

• Stefano Luzzatto (ICTP Trieste)

• Yakov Pesin (Pennsylvania State University)

• Federico Rodriguez-Hertz (Pennsylvania State University)

Additionally there will be several research seminars, and possibly short
contributed talks by some of the participants.

Some funds are available to offer financial support to a limited number
of selected students and young researchers. The deadline for application
is 12th April 2017.

Planned in conjunction with this school, a workshop on hyperbolic
dynamics will take place at ICTP, Trieste the following week 19-23 June
2017. Registration, participation and funding for the two events are
independent of each other. Details of the workshop can be found
at [https://indico.ictp.it/event/7970/](https://indico.ictp.it/event/7970/).

The Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP),
Trieste is organizing a Workshop in Hyperbolic Dynamics with an emphasis
on topics that have benefited from the seminal contributions of
Yakov Pesin, on the occasion of his 70th birthday.

The workshop will take place at ICTP, Trieste on 19-23 June 2017 and
will include lectures by internationally renowned speakers who have led
the progress in the field over several decades. There will be
ample opportunities for interaction and discussion amongst participants
of all levels of experience.The workshop is organized in conjunction
with a school in Hyperbolic Dynamics which will be held on 12-16
June 2017 at the Centro di Ricerca Matematica Ennio de Giorgi, Pisa,
with mini-courses by D. Dolgopyat (Maryland), S. Luzzatto (ICTP), Y.
Pesin (Penn State), F. Rodriguez-Hertz (Penn State) and some invited
seminars. Details can be found on the website of the school
at: [https://crm.sns.it/event/410/](https://crm.sns.it/event/410/) Registration, participation and
funding for the two events are independent of each other.
