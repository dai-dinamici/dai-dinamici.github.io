This website uses [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org "MathJax"), a
JavaScript library able to compile and render latex live in your
browser. The syntax is fully explained here:
<https://wordpress.org/plugins/mathjax-latex/>. Briefly:

-    `display style` formulas can be obtained as in the standard latex
    syntax by typing them between double dollars or escaped square
    brackets (`$$ ... $$` or `\[ ... \]` );
-   `inline style` formulas use the slightly non-standard syntax
    `$latex ... $` or `\( ... \)`.

 

Examples:

-   `$latex e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$` is rendered as $latex e^{i\\pi} + 1 = 0$;
-    `\(\int_0^1 x dx = \frac12\)` is rendered as \\(\\int\_0^1 x dx =
    \\frac12 \\);
-   finally ` $$\|z\| = 0$$` is rendered as  $$\\|z\\| = 0.$$

 

You can freely use mathematical formulas in comments and posts.
