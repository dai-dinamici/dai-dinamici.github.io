Job openings to bring to the attention of potential candidates:

-   two 2-year Postdoc positions
-   one PhD position   

available at the RWTH Aachen University, starting June 2019, or within 
6 months thereafter.

These are mostly research positions, with a  teaching load consisting of
exercise sections for undergraduate courses.

For the Postdoc positions, candidates are expected to conduct research 
in Symplectic/Contact Topology and/or Symplectic Dynamics, or Systolic
Geometry.

The successful candidate for the PhD position will conduct research in 
Symplectic Dynamics, comprising the use of methods from Symplectic 
Geometry/Topology to study the global structure of Hamiltonian  systems.
Among such methods we emphasize Floer Theory and Symplectic  Field
Theory.
