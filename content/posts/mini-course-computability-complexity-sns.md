[Prof. Michael Yampolsky](https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/math-cs-stats/people/michael-yampolsky) 
(University of Toronto Mississauga) will give a series of 4 lectures on 
_"Computability and Computational Complexity Questions in Dynamics"_ at the Scuola Normale 
Superiore in Pisa. The lectures will take place on Thursdays October 24 and 31 and November 
7 and 14, at 4:30 pm in Aula Volterra, Piazza dei Cavalieri 7. The titles and abstracts of 
the 4 lectures are given below.

**October 24:** _Computability and computational complexity in dynamics: can we trust 
numerical predictions of limiting behavior of orbits?_  
The development of the modern subject of dynamical systems went hand-in-hand with 
numerical modeling. However, the theoretical basis of such modeling has remained 
largely unexplored and offers exciting challenges. What can and cannot be computed 
about the behavior of a dynamical system? I will give an overview of some of the 
recent results and directions of study.

**October 31:** _Donâ€™t believe your lying eyes: (non)-computability of Julia sets._  
The talk will be a deep dive into the question of computability and computational 
complexity of Julia sets. Their fractal images are among the most-computed pictures 
in all of mathematics. But can we trust what these computations show? The results 
are surprising, and involve some beautiful complex analysis. The talk will be based 
on my work with M. Braverman, as well as more recent results obtained with A. Dudko, 
C. Rojas, and others.

**November 7:** _How to lose at Monte Carlo: computing statistical behavior of 
dynamical systems._  
Introduced by Ulam and von Neumann in the 1940s, Monte Carlo technique remains the 
most ubiquitous tool for statistical modeling. Surprisingly, our recent work with 
C. Rojas shows that such modeling provably fails for some very simple dynamical 
systems. I will present this theorem and discuss the resulting mathematical challenges.

**November 14:** _Thurston versus Turing: algorithmic hardness of classifying finite 
dynamical systems._  
Historically, the algorithmic aspects of classification problems have motivated 
much of the research in geometric topology (knot theory, classification of 
surfaces and 3-manifolds, etc). These questions are also very fruitful in 
dynamics. I will discuss the joint results with N. Selinger, K. Rafi and others 
on algorithmic decidability of Thurston equivalence and the connection with 
geometrization questions in dynamics.
