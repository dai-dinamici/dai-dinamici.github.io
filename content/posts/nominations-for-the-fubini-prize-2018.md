We invite to nominate candidates for the Fubini Prize 2018. The prize
supports a young mathematician whose researches are based in Italy
(under 40 at the end of the year, and resident in Italy or temporarily
resident abroad) who has obtained results in the fields of pure or
applied mathematics and is recognized for his studies by the
international scientific community.  The age of 40 is increased by one
year for each child if  the mathematician is a woman.

The prize is awarded every second year: please look at the Fubini Prize
