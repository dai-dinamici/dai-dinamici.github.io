This is the first announcement for the five week Simons semester **"Continued Fractions, Fractals, Ergodic Theory and Dynamics"**, which will take place 
**from April 27 to May 31, 2026** at the Institute of Mathematics of the Polish Academy of Sciences (IM PAN), Poland.

This semester will feature a school and a workshop:
