On **13-16 December 2022**, the Centro "De Giorgi" of Pisa will host the workshop 
**Statistical and Computational Aspects of Dynamics**.

See the [page of the event](http://www.crm.sns.it/event/507/) for further details.

Aims: After its establishment in the late 19th century through the efforts of Poincar√© and Lyapunov, 
the theory of dynamical systems was applied to study the qualitative behaviour of dynamical processes in the real world. 
In such applications, problems related to parameter estimation, prediction and phase reconstruction in dynamics are ubiquitous 
and solving them involves the use of numerous statistical and computational techniques. 
The goal of this workshop is to provide a meeting place for those who work in these problems and initiate collaborations.
