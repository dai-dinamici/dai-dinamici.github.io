project, especially the University Paris-Sud.

**Research:** This postdoctoral position is funded by the ANR project
ISDEEC. This project concerns the qualitative dynamics of PDEs and ODEs
and lies in the interface of dynamical systems theory, PDE techniques,
control theory, geometry, functional analysis... One of the main topics
