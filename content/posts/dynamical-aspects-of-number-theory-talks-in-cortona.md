On Thursday 3rd September there will be a special session at the 17th
European Women in Maths general meeting in Cortona on "Dynamical aspects
of number theory".  It runs from 10:00 - 13:00, and there will be short
talks by Valerie Berthé, Karma Dajani, Charlene Kalle, Henna Koivusalo
and Nicola Oswald.

Registration for the conference is unfortunately already closed, but if
anyone is nearby and wants to come only for this morning session, I
can't imagine there would be any problem. (I hope this goes without
saying, but let me say it anyway, men are obviously welcome to attend
the talks too.)
