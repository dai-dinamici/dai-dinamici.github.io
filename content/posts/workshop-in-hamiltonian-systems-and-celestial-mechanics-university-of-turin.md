On 14-16 December 2022, the University of Turin, Italy, will host a three-day **workshop in hamiltonian systems and celestial mechanics**.

The workshop gathers recognized international experts which will present their recents contributions to the field of Hamiltonian Systems, with a special focus on Celestial Mechanics. 

During these three days of conferences, many different aspects related to the above topics will be deepened. A major emphasis will be given on the theoretical aspects (e.g., dynamical systems, perturbation theory, variational methods, symplectic techniques), while more applied results will be also discussed.
