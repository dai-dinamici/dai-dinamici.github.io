**Overview:** In the past 15 years there has been remarkable progress in
studying statistical properties of hyperbolic dynamical systems by using
functional analytic techniques and coupling methods. In parallel, new
computer assisted proofs and algorithms have been developed to compute
SRB measures, almost invariant sets/coherent structures, dimensions of
attractors, and other important dynamical quantities. This workshop aims
to bring together both pure and computationally-oriented ergodic
theorists in order to bridge cutting-edge theoretical discoveries with
new and interesting computational developments.
