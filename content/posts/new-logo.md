As you may have noticed, our website has gone through a restyling.
In the process, we moved to a much simpler deployment strategy, which should make our website much much faster than before, and safer and easier to maintain for us.
The price to pay for this, is that you will need to contact us to submit new posts, unless you want to [get your hands dirty](https://github.com/dai-dinamici/).

This is not all! Thanks to the efforts and the patience of Giovanni Canestrari, and the pushes from Marco Lenci, the DinAmicI are excited to share wity you also the new logo:

Throughout those years, we have gone through a number of iterations.
The original

only lasted a few weeks, before being modified into

![Original logo with ball]({{< resource url="wp-content/DAI-orig-1.png" >}})

After that, we decided to work on our classical animation

![Animated Logo]({{< resource url="wp-content/DINAMICI_2_2.gif" >}})

and the corresponding

![Latest logo]({{< resource url="wp-content/DAI1.png" >}})

The new logo, and the new website, mark a new step into the development of the group and the association.
