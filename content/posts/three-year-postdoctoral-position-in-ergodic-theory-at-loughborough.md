Loughborough University is seeking to appoint a Postdoctoral Research
Associate in the area of Smooth Ergodic Theory to conduct research under
the direction of Dr Wael Bahsoun on an EPSRC funded project “Transfer
operators and emergent dynamics in hyperbolic systems”. The project also
involves collaboration with Prof. Mark Pollicott (Warwick) and with
Prof. Carlangelo Liverani (Rome). 

The appointee will be based in the [Department of Mathematical
Sciences](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/maths/) at Loughborough
University. 

Candidates should have a PhD in Mathematics and should be interested in
conducting research on Smooth Ergodic Theory / Dynamical Systems via
transfer operator techniques. 

The duration of this appointment is for 36 months, starting 1 October
2021 or as soon as possible thereafter. 

For informal discussions about this role please contact
([W.Bahsoun@lboro.ac.uk](W.Bahsoun@lboro.ac.uk)).
