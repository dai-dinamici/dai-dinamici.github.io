A postdoctoral position is available within the ANR project COSY: *"New
challenges in contact and symplectic topology"*.

This is a research-only appointment (without teaching) for two years
starting in October 2022. The salary will be 2000 euros per month and up
depending on experience, with benefits including health insurance and
social coverage. Funds will also be provided for traveling and inviting
collaborators.

The successful candidate will be expected to interact with some
researchers in contact and symplectic topology from the poles of the
project: 
- *Université Paris-Saclay (Orsay) and Université de Strasbourg*
- *Sorbonne Université and Ecole Normale Supérieure (Paris)*
- *Université de Lyon 1 and Université Grenoble-Alpes*
- *Université de Nantes and Université de Toulouse 3*  
  
For this reason, the scientific project should explain how the applicant
plans to integrate one or two institutions from the above list; to this
end, applicants are invited to contact directly the members with whom
they want to interact.

Applications are welcome in all themes of contact and symplectic
topology. The scientific projects are expected to emphasize the
connections with the two broad themes of COSY: Lefschetz fibrations and
open book decompositions, and persistent homology.

**Eligibility:** For holders of a Ph.D in Mathematics obtained before
October 1st, 2022.

**Deadline:** Applications must be complete (including all reference
letters) by February 1st, 2022.

**Requested items:**  
- a curriculum vitae;
- a list of publications;
- a scientific project (max. 4 pages) specifying members of COSY with
whom the applicant plans to interact primarily, as well as the
envisioned location(s) for the postdoctoral contract;
- three detailed recommendation letters submitted directly by the
referees.
