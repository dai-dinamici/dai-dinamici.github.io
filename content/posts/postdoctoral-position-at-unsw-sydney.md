Applications are sought for a Postdoctoral Research Fellow position in
Smooth Ergodic Theory and Dynamical Systems in UNSW’s School of
Mathematics and Statistics.  Although experience in both Smooth Ergodic
Theory and Dynamical Systems is preferred, all candidates with strong
qualifications in Dynamical Systems and related fields of research are
encouraged to apply and will be carefully considered.

About the role

• $89,051 - $96,677 plus 17% superannuation

• Full-time position for a fixed term of up to 2 years with the
possibility of extension of up to a further year.

• No teaching duty is required, but there may be opportunities if
desired.

This position is funded by an Australian Research Council Discovery
Project Grant.  The successful applicant will play a leading role within
a collaborative research team led by Prof. Gary Froyland and Dr Cecilia
Gonzalez-Tokman (University of Queensland), including researchers from
the Centre de Physique Théorique, Luminy, Marseille and the Institute
for Marine and Atmospheric Research, Department of Physics, Utrecht
University.

The core of this project is the development of ergodic-theoretic
frameworks and statistical limit law theory for non-autonomous or driven
dynamical systems, focusing on differentiable and measurable analysis
methods. These new techniques will be implemented and applied to
dynamical systems models of the ocean and atmosphere.

About the successful applicant

To be successful in this role you will have:

• PhD in Mathematics, or near completion, preferably in Ergodic Theory
or Dynamical Systems.

• Demonstrated ability to publish in internationally refereed journals
relative to opportunity.

• Demonstrated high level analytical and problem-solving skills
supported by a strong publication record.

An applicant may be required to undergo pre-employment checks prior to
appointment to this role.

You should systematically address the selection criteria listed within
the position description in your application. Please apply online at:
