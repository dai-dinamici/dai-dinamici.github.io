This is the announcement of the conference **"Dynamics, Number theory and Probability"** that will be held at the 
University of Exeter (UK), from **January 11 to 12th, 2026**.

The conference is a two day event showing new directions combining ergodic theory and dynamical systems with number theory and probability theory. 
In order to make the talks more accessible for younger researchers (in particular last year undergraduate students and PhD students) there will be some 
introductory talks before the start of the conference.
