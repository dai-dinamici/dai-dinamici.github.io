In the second half of May and beginning of June 2024, there are three events at the Jagiellonian University in Kraków related to dynamical systems:

On **20-24 May**, there is a workshop on *"Higher order Fourier analysis and combinatorial ergodic theory"* with minicourses 
by Pablo Candela (Higher-order Fourier analysis) and Joel Morreira (Ergodic Ramsey theory). 
See: [https://www.fi.muni.cz/research/dimea/algomanet2024krakow.html](https://www.fi.muni.cz/research/dimea/algomanet2024krakow.html)

On **27-31 May**, there is a workshop on *"Dynamics and number theory"*, covering a variety of topics and offering an opportunity to give 
research talks for those of you who already have some research
results. There will be 4 minicourses: Dmitry Dolgopyat (Limit theorems for Kronecker sequences), Maksym Radziwill (Fine distribution of sequences modulo 1), 
Andreas Strömbergsson (Effective equidistribution in homogeneous dynamics via techniques from analytic number theory), Matthew Welsh (The dynamics of theta sums).

On **6-9 June**, there is a workshop in the framework of the [wandering seminars](https://etds.im.uj.edu.pl/wandering/) (homepage will soon be updated there) 
on the dynamics of B-free numbers and related dynamical systems.

Registration to the first workshops is open. For more details, see the webpages of these events.
