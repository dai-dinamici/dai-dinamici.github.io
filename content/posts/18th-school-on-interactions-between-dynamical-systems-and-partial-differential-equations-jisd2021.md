**18th School on interactions between Dynamical Systems and Partial
Differential Equations (JISD2021)**  
**June 28  – July 2, 2021**  
[**Centre de Recerca Matemàtica**](https://www.crm.cat/2021/JISD)

The JISD is an annual meeting between experts and young researchers in
Dynamical Systems and Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). It is
designed to encourage and enhance exchange of knowledge and methods,
with the goal of advancing the study of cutting-edge problems in the
aforesaid fields of mathematics and with the aim of fostering the
interaction among the participants. The symposium is aimed at local
researchers, as well as scientists from the rest of Spain and foreign
countries. It is organized into four advanced courses of about 7 hours
and complemented by a poster session by young researchers. Throughout
the latest editions the attendance numbers have ranged between 60 and
100 participants, mostly internationals. JISD former editions
