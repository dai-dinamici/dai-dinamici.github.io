From July 14-18, 2025, the Universit√§t Heidelberg, Germany, will host a **Workshop on Billiards and Quantitative Symplectic Geometry**.

The workshop will bring together researchers working in dynamical systems, geometry, and symplectic methods, with a focus on the latest developments in billiard systems and their interplay with symplectic geometry.

The organizers especially encourage junior researchers to participate and apply for contributed talks (20-minute slots) to present their work.
