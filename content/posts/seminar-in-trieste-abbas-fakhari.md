"Ergodicity of Surface Actions via Flag Manifold"

Abstract: This talk is devoted to study the ergodicity of smooth surface
actions. We provide a sufficient condition for surface actions to be
ergodic with respect to the Lebesgue measure. First, we address the main
results obtained so far for the unit circle, as a main tool in higher
dimensional. After that, by introducing the notion of flag manifold, we
explain how rich minimality of sufficiently smooth action on the flag
manifold may lead to the ergodicity of the initial action.
