**Event Details**

*Date and Time*: 
- 3 pm-5 pm on March 7th(Tuesday)

- 3 pm-5 pm on March 13th(Monday)

*Timezone*: Japan time

**Topic**

The main topic of the minicourse is dynamics of Bikhoff billiards or billiards in convex bounded regions. Motivated by the famous question “Can you hear the shape of a drum?” We shall discuss several notions of deformational spectral rigidity for convex billiards. It turns out that techniques to study these notions are also applicable to perturbative Birkhoff Conjecture about integrable billiards.
