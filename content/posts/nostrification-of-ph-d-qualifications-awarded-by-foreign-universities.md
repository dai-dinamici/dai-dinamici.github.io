This year there have been some upgrades to the Italian laws ruling the
recruitment in the universities. One of these upgrades concerns the
documents required to apply for calls for the positions of "junior or
senior RTD" (temporary assistant professor).

The main change is about the document proving the Ph.D. qualification.
In particular, some universities (please don't ask why not all of them)
are now asking that participants to a call declare that they have
obtained the nostrification of the Ph.D. qualification, or that they
have at least sent the request for the nostrification to the Italian
Ministry of Education, Universities and Research.

Hence, if you have earned your Ph.D. outside Italy and are thinking of
applying for a junior or senior RTD position in Italy, it is a good idea
if you take a look at the following link
