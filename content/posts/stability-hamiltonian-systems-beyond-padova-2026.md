+++

This is the announcement of the two related conferences **"Stability of Hamiltonian systems and beyond"** and **“FassòFest"** 
that will be held at the Department of Mathematics “Tullio Levi-Civita” of the University of Padova (Italy), from **January 26 to 31st, 2026**.

The two conferences will focus on the most important theoretical aspects in the study of Hamiltonian systems and their stability properties, 
specifically motivated by the quest for extending this analysis and the available tools beyond the current range of applicability, including to certain types of non Hamiltonian systems.
The conference FassòFest will be a celebration of our colleague and friend Francesco Fassò on the occasion of his 70th birthday.

**Dates**: 26-29th January 2026 (*Stability of Hamiltonian systems and beyond*), 30-31st January 2026 (*FassòFest*)

**Location**: Department of Mathematics “Tullio Levi Civita”, University of Padova, Italy.

The conferences will host mostly invited talks and there will be a poster session.

**Deadline for registration**: November 30th, 2025.
