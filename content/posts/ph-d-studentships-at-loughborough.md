**Ph.D. Studentships at Loughborough University**

**Title:* ***Rare Events in Dynamical Systems via Transfer Operator
Techniques

**Supervisor:** Wael Bahsoun ([W.Bahsoun@lboro.ac.uk](W.Bahsoun@lboro.ac.uk); phone
+44-15-09-222883).

**Nature of work:** Theory

**Area:** Mathematics: Ergodic Theory and Dynamical Systems

**Brief description:** The study of rare events in dynamical systems is
currently one of the most active branches of research in ergodic theory.
In part, this is due to their interesting applications in earth and
ocean sciences. An example of a rare event in dynamical systems appears
in the study of ‘open’ systems where orbits infrequently escape from the
domain, typically by falling into a small “hole” in the phase space. The
goal of the project is to use spectral techniques (via the so called
Perron-Frobenius operator) to approximate escape rates in open systems
and to compute the Hausdorff dimension of survival sets.

**How to apply:**

All applications should be made online
at [https://www.lboro.ac.uk/study/apply/research/](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/study/apply/research/).  Under programme
name, select ‘Mathematical Sciences’. Please quote reference number:
 MA/WB/2018. Closing date of advert: **16th February 2018.**

**Funding and eligibility:**

The studentships are open to UK/EU graduates with backgrounds in
relevant disciplines and who are articulate, well qualified and highly
motivated.  These studentships can provide a £14,553 per annum (2017
rate) tax-free stipend plus tuition fees at the UK/EU rate.
 International (non-EU) students may apply however the total value of
the studentship will be used towards the cost of the International
tuition fee in the first instance.  Please see individual studentship
funding criteria for full details and eligibility conditions.

Funded studentships will be awarded on a competitive basis across the
projects to successful applicants who have applied for the
above-mentioned projects.

Successful candidates will be expected to register for
1st October 2018 or as soon as possible thereafter.
