Announcement of the Winter School:

"**Implicit function theorems in Geometry and Dynamics**"

which will take place on

February 19 - 22, 2020

at Schloss Rauischholzhausen, a castle which is the congress hotel of
the University of Gießen  <https://schloss.faber-management.de/>.

The aim of the school is to present to master and PhD students two
incarnations of the implicit function theorem that have strong
influences on contemporary research, namely the implicit function
theorem of Nash and Moser, and the implicit function theorem in scale
calculus and polyfold-theory as developed by Hofer, Wysocki and Zehnder.

There will be two mini-courses on the theoretical framework of each
incarnation by Massimiliano Berti and Benjamin Filippenko, which will be
complemented by research talks and seminars on classical applications.

All interested Master and PhD Students are invited to register following
the instructions at the homepage of the
event <https://sites.google.com/view/ifthm-gnd/startseite>
