Up to three fully-funded studentships are available for highly-motivated
candidates to undertake PhD research within the Department of
Mathematics at Aberystwyth University.

The research group in Mathematical Modelling of Structures, Solids and
Fluids has an international reputation in the study of complex fluids
and structures, offering a unified approach to the mathematical
modelling, computation and analysis of materials.

Projects should be in the area of mathematical modelling of multiphysics
phenomena in complex materials with microstructure, for example
deformation, waves, fracture and damage propagation in inhomogeneous
structures.

These three-year studentships are available from September 2015, paying
the usual stipend and tuition fees at the level appropriate for UK and
EU students. Candidates should have a first or upper second class degree
(or equivalent) in applied mathematics or a related subject. They will
be expected to travel and present at conferences and undertake
secondments with industrial and/or academic partners overseas.

Informal enquiries may be made to Prof. Gennady Mishuris
([ggm@aber.ac.uk](mailto:ggm@aber.ac.uk)) or to Prof. Simon Cox ([sxc@aber.ac.uk](mailto:sxc@aber.ac.uk)).
