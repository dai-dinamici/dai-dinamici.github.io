title = "Two ESR (Early Stage Researcher) positions, University of Rome Tor Vergata"
+++

As part of the Marie Curie Initial Training Network, STARDUST-R, the
Department of Mathematics of the University of Rome Tor Vergata offers 2
fully funded ESR positions on the following subjects:  

1\) Dynamics of space debris within different orbital elements
regions;  

2\) Proper elements for Space Debris.

**MSCA ELIGIBILITY CRITERION:** At the time of appointment applicants
should have no more than 4 years experience after graduation and should
not have resided in Italy for more than 12 months in the last 3 years
immediately before the appointment.

  
**REQUIREMENTS:** All qualified candidates irrespective of gender or
nationality are welcome to apply as long as the following conditions
have been fulfilled:  
• A successful candidate must hold (or expect to obtain) a Master degree
in Mathematics, Physics, Astronomy, Astrophysics, Engineering or
Computer Science  
• Knowledge of a computer language or algebraic manipulator (C, Fortran,
MATLAB, Mathematica) is desirable  
• A successful candidate should have good oral and written communication
skills in English  
  
**APPLICATIONS:** Interested applicants should send by e-mail
(celletti@mat.uniroma2.it as well as to info@stardust-network.eu) the
following documents:  
a) curriculum vitae (CV) following the template available at
https://www.stardust-network.eu/about/jobs/ ;  
b) transcripts and certificates;  
c) two letters of reference to be sent to celletti@mat.uniroma2.it;  
d) cover letter explaining their motivation, research interests and the
ranked preference for posts.  
  
**APPLICATION DEADLINE:** 31.03.2019  
  
**ENVISAGED JOB STARTING DATE: ** October 2019

  
**BENEFITS:** The selected ESR will be recruited on a fixed term staff
contract with salary, having the opportunity to be enrolled in a
doctoral program at the University of Rome Tor Vergata.  

**OPEN FOR INTERNATIONAL ESR:** Yes  

**SELECTION:** The selection will be on the basis of the CV and an
interview (possibly via skype); the committee might decide to propose a
research project as an exercise to be performed within a limited amount
of time. Shortlisted candidates will be informed.  

**CONTACT INFORMATION:** Prof. Alessandra Celletti
(celletti@mat.uniroma2.it) or info@stardustnetwork.eu  

**JOB DESCRIPTION:**  
**a) Research:**  

ESR-UTV1: Analysis of lunisolar resonances, including the effect of
solar radiation pressure; investigation of highly eccentric objects
(HEO), which might be affected by conservative and dissipative forces
along their orbits, according to the altitude as the eccentricity
varies; study of highly inclined objects.  

ESR-UTV2: characterization of the populations of space debris by using
techniques of perturbation theory (normal forms); study how orbit
determination uncertainty propagates for control and mitigation of space
debris; implement perturbation theory to extend, to the fully non-linear
regime, linear variational methods  
currently used for determination of the growth in time of separation
between nearby orbits.  

**b) Training:** Attendance of schools and training events; Participate
in planned secondments; Collaboration with other ESRs through the
Working Groups,  

**c) Outreach activities:** i) Communication - to communicate through
multiple social media platforms; ii) Public Awareness - to participate
in the campaigns managed by the Stardust-R network; iii) Education
Outreach - to collaborate and engage directly with schools to inspire
pupils to take Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics subjects
to a higher education level.
