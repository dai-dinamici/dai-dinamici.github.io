# Online lectures *"Introduction to computational ergodic theory"*
## 1-5 August, 2022

The Hokkaido Summer Institute organizes a zoom online lecture series on computational ergodic theory on 1-5 August, 2022. The goal of the lectures is 
to introduce a software and the related theory providing tools for computer aided proofs and rigorous estimates on the statistical properties of dynamics. 
The lectures includes basics on ergodic theory, tutorials on the language Julia, with an introduction to interval arithmetic libraries and computer 
assisted proofs in dynamical systems and ergodic theory problems and the package RigorousInvariantMeasure.jl, now part of the JuliaDynamics organization
https://github.com/JuliaDynamics/RigorousInvariantMeasures.jl

Registration will be required to attend the zoom online lectures at <https://sites.google.com/view/hsi-comp-ergo-theo-2022/>
The lectures will be recorded and will be published after the school.

### "Introduction to computational ergodic theory"

Ergodic theory is a mathematical field that connects dynamical system theory and probability theory, and underlies statistical 
mechanics and nonlinear physics. However, mathematically, it is difficult to analyze even basic problems such as the uniqueness 
and existence of invariant densities. One of the purposes of this lectures is to learn how a functional analytic approach can be 
used for these kind of problems in dynamical systems, giving an efficient method to get information on the invariant measures 
and on the statistical behavior of the system. The second purpose is to introduce the recently developed validated numerics 
for computer-assisted proofs in dynamical systems and ergodic theory and to understand the results of proof of existence 
of noise-induced phenomena in nonlinear physics.
