This is the first announcement of the school

**"Modern Aspects of Dynamical Systems"**

organized by [Fondazione CIME](https://web.math.unifi.it/users/cime/) to
be held in Cetraro (Cosenza, Italy) in the period 20-24 July 2020. The
venue of the school will be [Grand Hotel San
Michele](https://www.grandhotelsanmichele.it/).

(Universität Zürich).

The school will consist of the following courses:

-   Manfred Einsiedler: "Homogeneous dynamics and Diophantine
    approximation"
-   Giovanni Forni: "Effective ergodic theory for translation flows"
-   Vadim Kaloshin: "Integrability and rigidity for convex billiards"
-   Tere M-Seara: "Exponentially small phenomena and its role in the
    dynamics"
-   Jasmin Raissy: "Holomorphic dynamics"

Applications will be managed directly by Fondazione CIME through its
website. Applications open on **December 1st**, **2019** and close on
**April 30th, 2020**.
