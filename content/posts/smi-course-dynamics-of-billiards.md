title = "SMI Course on `Dynamics of Billiards’, Cortona, June 29 - July 4, 2025" 
+++

In the week **June 29 - July 4, 2025**, the 
[Scuola Matematica Interuniversitaria](https://www.smi-math.unipr.it/)
will offer a summer course in Cortona, Tuscany, on topics in mathematical billiards. 

The course will take place in the castle named Palazzone owned by the Scuola Normale 
Superiore. The intended audience consists of Ph.D. students writing their theses and 
postdocs. Applications are now open. Traditionally, 12 applicants will be offered free 
lodging, breakfast and lunch at the Palazzone. 

There will be two lecturers, who will cover the following programs:

[**Krzystof Burdzy**](https://sites.math.washington.edu//~burdzy/) (University of Washington):
*Borderline billiards theory (such as billiards with no borders)*  
The lecturer will discuss several models, including Archimedes' principle for an ideal gas, pinned billiard balls, rotating
billiard tables, and billiard balls in a space without walls. Some techniques that are related to or arose in these areas will be
presented.

[**Marco Lenci**](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/marco.lenci/en) (Universita’ di Bologna)
*An introduction to the theory of chaotic billiards*  
The course will give an introduction to the theory of hyperbolic billiards, developed by Sinai and his school some 50 years
ago. This theory — somehow sought after since the times of Boltzmann, Poincaré and Birkhoff — has had a profound impact
on the development of the theory of chaotic dynamical systems and its applications, and earned Yakov Sinai his 2014 Abel
Prize. The audience will get acquainted with the basic tools of hyperbolic dynamics in the presence of singularities and will
see a fairly detailed sketch of the proof of the ergodicity of the Sinai billiard, a.k.a. Lorentz gas. A minimal background in
measure theory is required; some rudiments of ergodic theory are welcome.

**Deadline for application:** April 15, 2025
