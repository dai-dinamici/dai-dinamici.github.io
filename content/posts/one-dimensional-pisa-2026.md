+++

This is the announcement of the conference **"One-Dimensional Dynamics and High-Dimensional Networks"** that will be held 
at the Centro di Ricerca Matematica Ennio De Giorgi, Pisa (Italy), on **April 20-24, 2026**. 

The meeting will bring together researchers in dynamical systems, with an emphasis on fostering interdisciplinary exchange between experts 
in one- and low-dimensional dynamics and those working on high-dimensional networked systems. The conference aims to explore recent advances 
at the established intersection between these areas and to uncover new connections. The conference is also an opportunity to celebrate 
the 70th birthday of Professor Sebastian van Strien, in recognition of his many contributions to these fields.

In case funding becomes available, precedence will be given to young participants selected to present a poster or short talk and 
who have no other means to support their participation. We particularly encourage applications from young participants with diverse backgrounds.

The conference will be held at Palazzo del Castelletto (Pisa) and last from Monday morning to Friday 15:30 (CEST).

Important dates are as follows:

Deadline to apply for funding: **22 February 2026**

Registration deadline: **16 March 2026**
