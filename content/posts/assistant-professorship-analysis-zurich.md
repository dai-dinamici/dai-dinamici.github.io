The *Faculty of Science of the University of Zurich* is inviting applications for an **Assistant Professorship in Analysis**

partial differential equations, calculus of variations, geometric analysis, or harmonic analysis.

in Zurich's rich and diverse research environment. UZH is an equal-opportunities employer and the Faculty of Science,
