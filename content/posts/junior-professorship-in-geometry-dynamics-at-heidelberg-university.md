Announcement for a **Junior professorship in Geometry & Dynamics** at
University of Heidelberg (Germany).

This is a 6-year (non-tenure track) position with a modest teaching load
and typical rights of a German professor (e.g. advising students etc.)
but very few administrative duties.

The successful applicant will find a stimulating research environment.
He/She will get the opportunity to become a member of the newly founded
Research Station “Geometry and Dynamics”.

Connections to the research areas within the Research Station “Geometry
and Dynamics” are expected.

There is ample opportunity to participate in existing third party
funding, for instance the Cluster of Excellence STRUCTURES, the
collaborative research center CRC/TRR 191 “Symplectic structures in
geometry, algebra, and dynamics”, or the Research Training Group 2229
“Asymptotic invariants and limits of groups and spaces”.

**Deadline for application:** December 31, 2021
