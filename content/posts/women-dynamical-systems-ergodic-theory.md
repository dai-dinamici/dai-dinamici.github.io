+++ categories = ["events", "news"] date = "2023-11-02 12:44:47" title = "Conference "Women in Dynamical Systems and Ergodic Theory" in Pisa" +++

The conference **"Women in Dynamical Systems and Ergodic Theory"** will take place at *Centro di Ricerca Matematica "Ennio De Giorgi", Pisa (Italy)*
on **May 20-24, 2024**. The event is organized by *Ayreena Bakhtawar, Carlo Carminati, and Tanja Schindler.*

The purpose of the event is to promote women and gender minorities working on Dynamical Systems and Ergodic Theory: 
the speakers will consist of women and non-binary people whereas all genders are welcome to attend the conference. 
The topic will cover different aspects of dynamical systems and ergodic theory such as e.g. statistical properties, 
numeration systems, Teichmüller theory and give connections to other mathematical areas, e.g. to geometry, number theory, 
Diophantine approximation and logic. The target audience would particularly be young researchers who want to explore 
different research directions within the broad field of dynamical systems and ergodic theory but also more senior ones, 
wanting to broaden their research by getting connections to research areas which so far don't lie in their core research field. 
Researchers at initial phases of their career will be supported and will be considered for a contributed talk.

The registration is open. All relevant information and the registration form can be found on the [website of the conference](http://www.crm.sns.it/event/522/). 

There are spots open for some contributed talks (follow the links on the webpage to submit a title and abstract).  
Limited funds to cover accommodation expenses are available to early registered participants. 
The condition to obtain the financial support is to present a contributed talk.  The deadline for financial support is 15 January 2024. 
However, the travel costs will not be covered. Funding decisions and decisions on contributed talks will be made by early February.  
Please feel free to share this announcement with any groups, students, post docs, or scholars who might be interested in participating in this conference.
