+++

This is to advertise a postdoc (initially 2 years, extendable to 3+ years) in dynamical systems as part of a small centre.

The Postdoctoral Fellow will undertake research within a five-year Laureate Fellow project funded by the Australian Research Council and UNSW Sydney. 
The project seeks to advance the analysis of dynamical systems through the development of novel techniques in functional analysis, operator theory, ergodic theory, 
differential geometry, and/or data science. Specific topics of focus include, but are not limited to, linear response, random and nonautonomous dynamical systems, 
spectral analysis, machine learning, data-driven dynamics, stability/perturbation theory/rigorous numerics.
Possible applications of the new theory include the analysis of spatiotemporal data arising from weather and climate observations/models and from models of social dynamics. 
Motivating aims include the discovery and analysis of hidden large-scale patterns in data/models, elucidating mechanisms underlying the emergence of these large-scale phenomena 
and their response to perturbations, and devising reliable automatic schemes for predicting this emergence and quantifying their response.

**Deadline for the application:** Thursday 20 November 2025
 
**Salary:** \$113K - \$121K plus 17% superannuation and annual leave loading

**Applications** should be submitted online using the following link: <https://external-careers.jobs.unsw.edu.au/cw/en/job/535933/postdoctoral-fellow-mathematics-statistics>
