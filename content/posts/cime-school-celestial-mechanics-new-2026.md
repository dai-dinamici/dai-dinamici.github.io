+++

As a follow up to the [first announcement](https://www.dinamici.org/2025/07/cime-school-celestial-mechanics-2026/), it's a pleasure to communicate that the registrations 
for the CIME summer school on **"New Challenges in Celestial Mechanics"**
which will take place on **June 6-10, 2026** at [Hotel San Michele](https://www.grandhotelsanmichele.it/), Cetraro (Italy), are now open with deadline on **April 15th, 2026**. 

The school will consist of four mini-courses: Alain Albouy, "The changes of time in classical and celestial mechanics, from the examples”;
Kostantin Batygin, “Orbital Dynamics of the Trans-Neptunian Solar System”; Alessandra Celletti, “Perturbative methods in Celestial Mechanics”;
Marian Gidea, “Arnold Diffusion in Celestial Mechanics”. 

The first aim of the School is to engage students in Celestial Mechanics, a classic field of research between Mathematics and Astronomy, 
which is still nowadays rich of open problems and opportunities. Moreover, the high level of the proposed courses should also attract the attention 
of senior scientists in the field. Early career researchers (PhD Students and PostDoc Researchers) can apply for grants covering local expenses.

You can apply for the School at the website

where you can find all the details.

The School is organized through the support of the [International Mathematical Summer Center](https://sites.google.com/unifi.it/cime/).
