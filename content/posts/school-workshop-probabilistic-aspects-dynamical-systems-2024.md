In the framework of the semester on "Fractals and Hyperbolic Dynamical Systems" a school and a workshop will take place 
in *August 2024* at the *Erdős Center in Budapest, Hungary* organised by *Péter Bálint, Péter Nándori, Françoise Pène, Domokos Szász, Imre Péter Tóth*.

The webpage of the **School on probabilistic aspects of hyperbolic systems (August 12, 2024 - August 16, 2024)** is available at
[https://erdoscenter.renyi.hu/events/school-probabilistic-aspects-hyperbolic-dynamical-systems](https://erdoscenter.renyi.hu/events/school-probabilistic-aspects-hyperbolic-dynamical-systems)

Registration is open at

The school is targeted at PhD students and recent graduates/early postdocs and features minicourses held by professors Mark Demers, Dmitry Dolgopyat, 
Gary Froyland and Carlangelo Liverani. There is some financial support available. Further details can be found on the above links.
