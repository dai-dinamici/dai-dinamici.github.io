The activities of the Virtual Ergodic Conference will take place in three consecutive weeks, from June 21 to July 9, 2021. While schedules are thought to adapt most time zones, these are specially fitted to North &amp;amp; South America (week 1), Europe &amp;amp; Africa (week 2) and Asia &amp;amp; Australia (week 3). The format will try to preserve the atmosphere of the Chapel Hill Ergodic Theory Workshops with some adaptations to match current virtual modalities.</description></item><item><title>Dynamical systems talk in Milano</title><link>https://dai-dinamici.github.io/2021/06/dynamical-systems-talk-in-milano/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jun 2021 09:32:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dai-dinamici.github.io/2021/06/dynamical-systems-talk-in-milano/</guid><description>Seminario Matematico e Fisico di Milano

Speaker: Jacopo De Simoi (University of Toronto)
Title: Dynamical rigidity of convex billiards Abstract: Convex billiards are a classical topic in conservative dynamics. Typically, their dynamics is qualitatively very intricate, since it showcases a coexistence of hyperbolic dynamics and KAM phenomena. Understanding long-term statistical properties of the dynamics with the current technology is essentially an intractable problem. Here I venture in the opposite direction and I will discuss dynamical inverse problems: how much geometrical information can be extracted from the dynamics?</description></item><item><title>Online Ph.D. course on translation surfaces, June-July 2021</title><link>https://dai-dinamici.github.io/2021/06/online-ph.d.-course-on-translation-surfaces-june-july-2021/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jun 2021 16:27:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dai-dinamici.github.io/2021/06/online-ph.d.-course-on-translation-surfaces-june-july-2021/</guid><description>The University of Pisa offers an online Ph.D. course taught by Mauro Artigiani (Universidad del Rosario, Colombia) and Paolo Giulietti (Università di Pisa) titled “Translation Surfaces: From Geometry to Spectral Theory”.
Description: Translation surfaces are a generalization of flat tori to higher genuses, with rich and interesting geometrical and dynamical properties. In fact, they can be seen both from a complex geometry point of view, stemming from the works of Teichmüller, Ahlfors and Bers, and also from a Euclidean geometry point of view, connecting to the works of the Russian school on low dimensional dynamics.</description></item><item><title>Online Ph.D. course on translation surfaces, June-July 2021</title><link>https://dai-dinamici.github.io/2021/06/online-ph-d-course-on-translation-surfaces-june-july-2021/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jun 2021 09:10:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dai-dinamici.github.io/2021/06/online-ph-d-course-on-translation-surfaces-june-july-2021/</guid><description>The University of Pisa offers an online Ph.D. course taught by Mauro Artigiani (Universidad del Rosario, Colombia) and Paolo Giulietti (Università di Pisa) titled &amp;ldquo;Translation Surfaces: From Geometry to Spectral Theory&amp;rdquo;.

&amp;ldquo;A geometric model for the natural extension of continued fraction maps&amp;rdquo;
Abstract: Just as classical &amp;ldquo;Floor&amp;rdquo; continued fractions induce the Gauss map on the real unit interval, other euclidean division algorithms (Ceiling, Even, Odd, NearestInteger, &amp;hellip;) induce piecewise-fractional maps with integer coefficients. All these maps have natural extensions that can easily be described on an ad hoc basis.
We present a general framework for dealing with all these maps in a uniform way.</description></item><item><title>Prima Giornata DinAmica - 25 November 2016</title><link>https://dai-dinamici.github.io/2016/09/prima-giornata-dinamica-25-novembre-2016/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Sep 2016 07:46:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dai-dinamici.github.io/2016/09/prima-giornata-dinamica-25-novembre-2016/</guid><description>This is a call for the participation of all DinAmicI to the Prima Giornata DinAmica, our first social meeting to be held on 25 November at the Gran Sasso Science Institute in L&amp;rsquo;Aquila.

&amp;ldquo;Ergodicity of Surface Actions via Flag Manifold&amp;rdquo;
Abstract: This talk is devoted to study the ergodicity of smooth surface actions. We provide a sufficient condition for surface actions to be ergodic with respect to the Lebesgue measure. First, we address the main results obtained so far for the unit circle, as a main tool in higher dimensional. After that, by introducing the notion of flag manifold, we explain how rich minimality of sufficiently smooth action on the flag manifold may lead to the ergodicity of the initial action.</description></item><item><title>ICTP-INdAM Research in Pairs in Mathematics</title><link>https://dai-dinamici.github.io/2016/08/ictp-indam-research-in-pairs-in-mathematics/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Aug 2016 08:37:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dai-dinamici.github.io/2016/08/ictp-indam-research-in-pairs-in-mathematics/</guid><description>ICTP and the Istituto Nazionale di Alta Matematica (INdAM) have launched a joint program of &amp;ldquo;Research in Pairs&amp;rdquo; aimed to fund research project in Mathematics to be carried out in collaboration between mathematicians from developing countries and INdAM members either at ICTP in Trieste or in any research unit of INdAM (see the list at https://www.altamatematica.it/it/node/43).

Abstract: In this talk I&amp;rsquo;ll show a completely different construction of equilibrium states associated to Hölder potentials for hyperbolic systems, and indicate the necessary modifications to deal with certain partially hyperbolic cases. The key point for this extension is avoiding altoghether the use of symbolic dynamics and the Perron-Frobenious method. Time permiting I&amp;rsquo;ll discuss applications.

&amp;ldquo;Martingale approximation for parametrised dynamical systems&amp;rdquo;
Abstract: In joint work with Alexey Korepanov and Zemer Kosloff, we prove statistical limit laws for sequences of the type \(\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}v_n\circ T_n^j\) where \(T_n\) is a family of nonuniformly hyperbolic transformations. The key ingredient is a new martingale-coboundary decomposition for nonuniformly hyperbolic transformations which is useful in the case when the family \(T_n\) is replaced by a fixed transformation \(T\), but which is particularly useful in the case when \(T_n\) varies with \(n\).</description></item><item><title>Mini-course on Double Resonances at IHP Paris on December 12-16, 2016</title><link>https://dai-dinamici.github.io/2016/07/mini-course-on-double-resonances-at-ihp-paris-on-december-12-16-2016/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Jul 2016 07:47:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dai-dinamici.github.io/2016/07/mini-course-on-double-resonances-at-ihp-paris-on-december-12-16-2016/</guid><description>Mini-course on Double Resonances on December 12-16, 2016 Jean-Pierre Marco and Vadim Kaloshin will give a mini-course on

“Families of hyperbolic Hamiltonian tori”
Thursday 11 February 2016, 15.00
Dipartimento di Matematica (aula Dal Passo) Università di Roma “Tor Vergata”
Abstract:
In integrable Hamiltonian systems hyperbolic tori form families, parametrised by the actions conjugate to the toral angles. The union over such a family is a normally hyperbolic invariant manifold. Under Diophantine conditions a hyperbolic torus persists a small perturbation away from integrability. Locally around such a torus the normally hyperbolic invariant manifold is the centre manifold of that torus and persists as well.</description></item><item><title>Dynamical systems in logic, complex analysis and ergodic theory</title><link>https://dai-dinamici.github.io/2016/02/dynamical-systems-in-logic-complex-analysis-and-ergodic-theory/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Feb 2016 16:44:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dai-dinamici.github.io/2016/02/dynamical-systems-in-logic-complex-analysis-and-ergodic-theory/</guid><description>The workshop &amp;ldquo;Dynamical systems in logic, complex analysis and ergodic theory&amp;rdquo; will be held in Pisa, from February 8 until 9, 2016.

“Permutable entire functions and multiply connnected wandering domains”
Abstract: Let f and g be permutable transcendental entire functions. It is a long standing question whether the Julia sets of f and g are equal. The conjecture is true in the case that f,g are rational functions, and in the transcendental case the main issues are due to the presence of Baker Domains and Wandering Domains.</description></item><item><title>"Renormalization in Dynamics" - Pisa, April 2016</title><link>https://dai-dinamici.github.io/2015/11/renormalization-in-dynamics-pisa-april-2016/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Nov 2015 10:52:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dai-dinamici.github.io/2015/11/renormalization-in-dynamics-pisa-april-2016/</guid><description>The conference &amp;ldquo;Renormalization in Dynamics&amp;rdquo; will be held in Pisa, from April 4 until 8, 2016.

Where: Seminario I, Dept. of Mathematics, Università di Bologna
Who: Francesco Cellarosi (Queen&amp;rsquo;s University, Canada)
What: Seminar &amp;ldquo;Recent progress towards Sarnak’s and Chowla’s Conjectures&amp;rdquo;
Abstract: I will present an overview of Sarnak’s conjecture on the disjointness of the Möbius function from any deterministic sequence and the related Chowla’s conjecture on the self-correlations of the Möbius function. Some progress towards weaker versions of these conjectures have been made recently, and I plan to illustrate them.</description></item><item><title>De Simoi's seminar in Pisa</title><link>https://dai-dinamici.github.io/2015/07/de-simois-seminar-in-pisa/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jul 2015 08:46:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dai-dinamici.github.io/2015/07/de-simois-seminar-in-pisa/</guid><description>Monday 20/7/2015, h 11:30-12:30 Sala Conferenze (Puteano, Centro De Giorgi)

&amp;ldquo;AN INTEGRABLE BILLIARD CLOSE TO AN ELLIPSE OF SMALL ECCENTRICITY IS AN ELLIPSE&amp;rdquo;
Abstract: In 1927 G. Birkhoff conjectured that if a billiard in a strictly convex smooth domain is integrable, the domain has to be an ellipse (or a circle). The conjecture is still wide open, and presents remarkable relations with open questions in inverse spectral theory and spectral rigidity.</description></item><item><title>Vaienti's seminar in Pisa</title><link>https://dai-dinamici.github.io/2015/07/seminario-di-vaienti-a-pisa/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jul 2015 15:24:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dai-dinamici.github.io/2015/07/seminario-di-vaienti-a-pisa/</guid><description>Friday, July 17, 2015, h. 16:00-17:00 Sala Conferenze (Puteano, Centro De Giorgi)
