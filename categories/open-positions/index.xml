&lt;p>&lt;strong>CALL OF INTEREST for DIRECT CALLS&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Department of Mathematics of the University of Roma Tor Vergata has been selected for the second time in a row as “Department of Excellence in Mathematics” in Italy and aims to hire mathematicians with an outstanding record of high impact research, excellence and leadership, according to the career age.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Selections of several positions will be made through 2023-2026.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Department of Mathematics of the University of Roma Tor Vergata welcomes expressions of interest for academic openings at Associate and/or Full Professor level from any field in Mathematics covered through a “direct call” procedure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Direct Calls program of the Italian Ministry of Research (MUR), provides opportunities to fund academic positions for scientists and scholars who have been working abroad with an equivalent position for at least three years, or for recipients of grants for Programs of Excellence funded by the European Research Council or Italian Ministry of Research (for instance ERC grants).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since the present action will be open for the period 2023-2026, also candidates who do not meet the requirements for being eligible for a Direct Call yet, but will do before 2026, are encouraged to apply.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Early career candidates can express their interest to be hired as tenure track Researcher (Italian rtdB/Rtt), since the Department of Mathematics is aiming to open such positions as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Successful candidates will be expected to actively contribute to the department’s academic program, its strategy and governance, as well as providing scientific leadership and applying to national and international research funding schemes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Applications must be submitted electronically filling the following form:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://forms.office.com/e/wrXb5tEwpj">https://forms.office.com/e/wrXb5tEwpj&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Department of Mathematics is committed to increasing the gender balance of its faculty and particularly welcomes applications from women mathematicians.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Additional Information&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For successful candidates having held academic positions abroad, there are some tax benefits, as, for example, a tax relief on 90% of the salary that may be granted for a duration up to six years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For more detailed information on tax benefits see the two following links:

&lt;p>The Direct Calls program of the Italian Ministry of Research (MUR), provides opportunities to cover teaching posts through direct calls to Italian and foreign scholars meeting one of the following necessary requirements:
scholars who have been working abroad on a permanent teaching or research position in a foreign university or research institution (art. 1 c.9 L. n. 230/2005) for at least THREE years, and holding an academic position equivalent to that which he is applying to with the direct call;
scholars who have already worked in teaching or research capacities in Italian universities for at least THREE years on a direct call basis authorized by the Ministry of Research (art. 1 c.9 L. 230/2005);
winners, as P.I., of grants for excellence programs funded by the European Research Council or Italian Ministry of Research (for instance ERC grants) of at least three years duration, and that have not been completed for more than three years (art. 29 c. 7 L. n. 240/2010, Art. 7, c. 2, D. M. n. 635/2016).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The applications will be reviewed by a Selection Committee and international experts. The selection committee will promptly notify chosen applicants, in order to start the administrative and burocratical steps needed to finalise the hiring process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Direct Call recruitment process involves several approval steps and requires the endorsement of the Ministry of Research.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The procedure is therefore expected to be completed and the position to be filled within about one year from the notification of the decision of the Department.&lt;/p>

title &lt;em>Merging Critical Orbits&lt;/em>. The position is sponsored by a grant
from the Dutch National Science Foundation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>General Description of the intended research:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Matching is a mysterious phenomenon which has recently been
observed  for several parameterized families of interval maps in the
deterministic and random settings. It is the property that for each
critical point the (random) orbits of the left and right limit merge
after some finite number of steps, and that the (expected value of the)
derivatives of both orbits are also equal at that time; this assures the
stability of this phenomenon under small perturbations of the parameter.
Since most of the dynamical behaviour of systems are encoded in the
possible trajectories of the critical points, knowledge on when and how
matching occurs can help in finding explicit expression for the natural
invariant measure. Once such a measure is found, one is able to obtain
essential information regarding the system, such as the frequency the
orbits enter a specific region, the entropy, the Lyapunov exponents,
mixing rates etc., and to make comparisons as the parameter varies.
There are many theorems that assert the existence of such invariant
measures, but there are few results that give a recipe for an explicit
formula, which is essential in describing the exact asymptotic
behaviour. We propose a new methodology to construct such measures and
to uncover their properties and behaviour under parameterized
perturbations. Our aim is to give a systematic way of analysing such
systems and to provide a new approach, with the help of matching, to
relate non-isomorphic systems that exhibit similar matching phenomena
and to extract information from one system to the other.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

*****************&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Department of Mathematics at the University of Rome Tor Vergata
invites expressions of interest for Senior (Tenure-Track) Assistant
Professor (&amp;lsquo;RTD-B&amp;rsquo;) and Tenured Associate Professor positions in any
area of Pure and Applied Mathematics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Who we are:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our Department has been consistently ranked in top positions within
Italy and Europe in Research Assessment Exercises held over the last
decade; it is the only Italian institution ranking in the top 100
worldwide for Mathematics according to the ARWU ranking of 2017.
Moreover, the Department has been recently ranked first in Italy and
hence financed by the Italian Ministry of Education, University and
Research (MIUR) under the program &amp;ldquo;Departments of Excellence&amp;rdquo; for the
2018-2022 period. More information about the Department and this program
can be found at&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.mat.uniroma2.it/">https://www.mat.uniroma2.it/&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>see also &lt;a href="https://www.mat.uniroma2.it/Progetto/">https://www.mat.uniroma2.it/Progetto/&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>What we offer:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Associate Professor&lt;/strong> is a tenured position. Applicants should have
an established track-record of publications in top international
journals and evidence of leadership and recognition in the international
academic community, including grant applications and project management.
Standards of excellence in teaching are also expected. The initial gross
salary of an Associate Professor is around 50k Euros per year. The net
amount after taxes depends on the total personal income, the composition
of the family and other parameters. To apply for an associate
professorship in Italy, the candidates must hold the &amp;ldquo;Abilitazione
Scientifica Nazionale&amp;rdquo; (Italian National Habilitation) as Associate
Professor, or must have been declared eligible by the Italian Ministery
of University and Research (MIUR), or must be currently employed in an
equivalent position in Italy or in a foreign Department.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Senior (Tenure-Track) Assistant Professor (RTD-B)&lt;/strong> is for three
years. Subject to evaluation, the position will be converted in a
tenured Associate Professorship. Applicants for this position must have
at least three years of experience after PhD completion, and an already
established research record. The initial gross salary is around 38k
Euros per year&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>A four-year tax exemption on 90% of the salary is available according to
the Italian tax law for those candidates who have been residing outside
Italy for 2 years or more. All positions will start not earlier than
2019. Moreover, the MIUR Excellence Grant will provide special funds to
attract PhD students and PostDocs to join the Department and host large
scientific events as well as other activities such as PhD courses,
seminars and workshops.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Procedure:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Applicants should express their interest by sending an email
to &lt;a href="mailto:progetto@mat.uniroma2.it">progetto@mat.uniroma2.it&lt;/a>, including a Curriculum Vitae and a list
of publications. The subject of the email should be Associate-surname or
RTDB-surname. Selected candidates could be invited for a seminar. There
are no restrictions regarding the nationality of the applicants.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please note that this is a call for interest, not a job vacancy
announcement; i.e., this call is only a preliminary stage aimed to
collect expressions of interest, and it is not a formal application for
positions. On the basis of the collected EoIs, the Department will
decide whether or not to open a position in specific subdisciplines.
Academic positions in Italy can only be awarded through a public
competition or direct appointment. The Department will contact the
applicants to inform them about the opening of the formal positions and
the required documentation.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Dear colleagues,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>in our department we are looking for students from outside Italyt hat
might be interested in doing their PhD in Pisa, starting nextacademic
year (that is, October/November 2018). I ask your help to bring this
message to the attention of students in your department that might be
interested.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Concerning support: this year we have 5 positions, 1 of which is
reserved for students who got a Master degree out of Italy. We expect
the call for these positions will open in June, it will be announced
on our webpage&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Note that&lt;/p>
&lt;p>* all these positions come with a three-year fellowship that can
fully support a student in Pisa, and some funds for research travels;
* candidates are supposed to get their master degree by October 2018
at the latest; * advanced courses in Pisa are usually taught in
English (at least if there are non-Italian students in the class) and
learning Italian is not mandatory; * even though the Scuola Normale
is a separate institution from the University of Pisa, we share
courses and all types of activities; indeed students from the
University can have an advisor at the Scuola, and viceversa; *
students that can secure themselves financial support from other
sources can apply for further positions.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Brief description:&lt;/strong> The study of rare events in dynamical systems is
currently one of the most active branches of research in ergodic theory.
In part, this is due to their interesting applications in earth and
ocean sciences. An example of a rare event in dynamical systems appears
in the study of ‘open’ systems where orbits infrequently escape from the
domain, typically by falling into a small “hole” in the phase space. The
goal of the project is to use spectral techniques (via the so called
Perron-Frobenius operator) to approximate escape rates in open systems
and to compute the Hausdorff dimension of survival sets.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Preference will be given to candidates who: 1) will benefit most from
the time spent at ICTP in pursuit of their own research, using the ICTP
facilities and participating in ICTP activities; and 2) will interact
with local scientists and visitors and will contribute to the
intellectual vitality of the Centre.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Candidates are required to arrange for the submission of three letters
of recommendation by established researchers. Incomplete applications
will not be considered. Successful candidates might be offered a
Shiing-Shen Chern Senior Post-Doctoral Fellowship.  The Fellowship,
named after Shiing-Chern, has especially attractive terms with a total
possible tenure of 3+2 years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Postdoctoral fellows will have the opportunity to participate in an
array of mathematics activities at the network of scientific
institutions in Trieste: ICTP, the International School of Advanced
Studies (ISAS/SISSA) and the University of Trieste.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Postdocs in Bologna</title><link>https://www.dinamici.org/2017/11/postdocs-in-bologna/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Nov 2017 22:15:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dinamici.org/2017/11/postdocs-in-bologna/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Department of Mathematics of Università di Bologna has opened a call

of extremes in dynamical systems.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Predicting high impact extreme events, such as severe weather and
climatic events is a major challenge. Using innovative mathematical
techniques this project will determine phenomenological mechanisms that
lead to the occurrence of extremes, and develop a theory that can be
used to predict when such events occur in physical modelling
applications. Using dynamical systems theory, the project will use
geometrical features of the underlying mathematical models to determine
the future extreme behaviour.&lt;/p>

progress and outcomes, communicate complex information, orally, in
writing and electronically and prepare proposals and applications to
external bodies.&lt;/strong> **&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Training &amp;amp; collaboration: **the successful applicant will collaborate
across disciplines and will actively participate in seminars, workshops
and conferences in the subject area.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Applicants will possess a relevant PhD in the general area of
Mathematics and be able to demonstrate sufficient knowledge in the

Engineering, Physics and Mathematics. The scholarship lasts 3 years, and
it is completely funded during this time. The winner has to attend the
Ph.D. school during these years and will have to write a dissertation to
earn the PhD degree.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The ideal candidate is a student familiar with Dynamical Systems, and
also with the concept of &amp;ldquo;network of dynamic agents&amp;rdquo;. Experience in
ODEs, PDEs or stochastic models is appreciated, but it is not necessary.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Complete information about the application procedure can be found at the
same link in English.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The application requires the candidate to submit a project and to attend
an interview. The project should be about 2 pages long, and it should be
a research proposal based on the skills and interests of the candidate.
Candidates may ask the tutors for the original research outline, and
freely adapt it to make it their own project. The final choice of the
type of scholarship will be done only at the end of the selection
process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Candidates are encouraged to get in touch with the scholarship tutors
before the deadline for more information about how to better present
