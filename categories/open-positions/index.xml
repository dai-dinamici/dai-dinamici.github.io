The position is sponsored by a grant from the Dutch National Science Foundation.
General Description of the intended research:
Matching is a mysterious phenomenon which has recently been observed for several parameterized families of interval maps in the deterministic and random settings. It is the property that for each critical point the (random) orbits of the left and right limit merge after some finite number of steps, and that the (expected value of the) derivatives of both orbits are also equal at that time; this assures the stability of this phenomenon under small perturbations of the parameter.</description></item><item><title>PhD Program in Mathematics at Università di Bologna</title><link>https://dai-dinamici.github.io/2021/04/phd-program-in-mathematics-at-universita-di-bologna/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Apr 2021 15:06:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dai-dinamici.github.io/2021/04/phd-program-in-mathematics-at-universita-di-bologna/</guid><description>The call for application for the Ph.D. Program in Mathematics (37th cycle - A.Y. 2021/2022) at Università di Bologna is now open. 7 fellowships are available.

*Title: ***Rare Events in Dynamical Systems via Transfer Operator Techniques
Supervisor: Wael Bahsoun (W.Bahsoun@lboro.ac.uk; phone +44-15-09-222883).
Nature of work: Theory
Area: Mathematics: Ergodic Theory and Dynamical Systems
Brief description: The study of rare events in dynamical systems is currently one of the most active branches of research in ergodic theory. In part, this is due to their interesting applications in earth and ocean sciences. An example of a rare event in dynamical systems appears in the study of ‘open’ systems where orbits infrequently escape from the domain, typically by falling into a small “hole” in the phase space.</description></item><item><title>8 Postdocs (including Dynamics) in São Paulo</title><link>https://dai-dinamici.github.io/2017/12/8-postdocs-including-dynamics-in-sao-paulo/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Dec 2017 18:00:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dai-dinamici.github.io/2017/12/8-postdocs-including-dynamics-in-sao-paulo/</guid><description>Postdoctoral positions at the University of São Paulo, Brazil
