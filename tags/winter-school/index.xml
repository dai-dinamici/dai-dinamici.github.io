&amp;ldquo;Implicit function theorems in Geometry and Dynamics&amp;rdquo;
which will take place on
February 19 - 22, 2020
at Schloss Rauischholzhausen, a castle which is the congress hotel of the University of Gie√üen https://schloss.faber-management.de/.
The aim of the school is to present to master and PhD students two incarnations of the implicit function theorem that have strong influences on contemporary research, namely the implicit function theorem of Nash and Moser, and the implicit function theorem in scale calculus and polyfold-theory as developed by Hofer, Wysocki and Zehnder.</description></item></channel></rss>
