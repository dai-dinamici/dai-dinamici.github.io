Title: Dynamical rigidity of convex billiards Abstract: Convex billiards are a classical topic in conservative dynamics. Typically, their dynamics is qualitatively very intricate, since it showcases a coexistence of hyperbolic dynamics and KAM phenomena. Understanding long-term statistical properties of the dynamics with the current technology is essentially an intractable problem. Here I venture in the opposite direction and I will discuss dynamical inverse problems: how much geometrical information can be extracted from the dynamics?</description></item><item><title>Postdoctoral fellowship in Dynamical Systems at Orsay (6 months)</title><link>https://www.dinamici.org/2021/06/post-doc-fellowship-in-dynamical-systems-at-orsay-6-months/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jun 2021 14:05:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dinamici.org/2021/06/post-doc-fellowship-in-dynamical-systems-at-orsay-6-months/</guid><description>A 6-month postdoctoral fellowship in Dynamical Systems has been announced at Orsay:

Title: Random-like properties of chaotic forcing
Abstract: We prove that skew systems with a sufficiently expanding base have &amp;ldquo;approximate&amp;rdquo; statistical properties similar to random ergodic Markov chains. For example, they exhibit approximate exponential decay of correlations, meaning that the exponential rate is observed modulo a controlled error. The fiber maps are only assumed to be Lipschitz regular and to depend on the base in a way that guarantees diffusive behaviour on the vertical component.</description></item><item><title>PhD position in Ergodic Theory at Utrecht University</title><link>https://www.dinamici.org/2021/05/phd-position-in-ergodic-theory-at-utrecht-university/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 May 2021 15:59:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dinamici.org/2021/05/phd-position-in-ergodic-theory-at-utrecht-university/</guid><description>PhD position available in Ergodic Theory at Utrecht University with title Merging Critical Orbits. The position is sponsored by a grant from the Dutch National Science Foundation.
General Description of the intended research:
Matching is a mysterious phenomenon which has recently been observed for several parameterized families of interval maps in the deterministic and random settings. It is the property that for each critical point the (random) orbits of the left and right limit merge after some finite number of steps, and that the (expected value of the) derivatives of both orbits are also equal at that time; this assures the stability of this phenomenon under small perturbations of the parameter.</description></item><item><title>Online Ph.D. course by Albert Fathi, June 2021</title><link>https://www.dinamici.org/2021/05/on-line-ph-d-course-by-albert-fathi-june-2021/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 May 2021 10:11:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dinamici.org/2021/05/on-line-ph-d-course-by-albert-fathi-june-2021/</guid><description>This online course is part of the Ph.D. program in Mathematics at University of Rome Tor Vergata.

Title: Torsion values of sections, elliptical billiards and diophantine problems in dynamics
Abstract: After a very brief review of basics on elliptic curves and their families, we shall consider &amp;ldquo;sections&amp;rdquo; of such families, and especially their &amp;ldquo;torsion values&amp;rdquo;. For instance, what can be said of the complex numbers b for which [latex](2, \sqrt{2(2-b)})[/latex] is torsion on the Legendre curve [latex]y^2=x(x-1)(x-b)[/latex]? In particular, we shall recall results of &amp;ldquo;Manin-Mumford type&amp;rdquo; and focus to illustrate some applications to elliptical billiards.</description></item><item><title>PhD Program in Mathematics at Università di Bologna</title><link>https://www.dinamici.org/2021/04/phd-program-in-mathematics-at-universita-di-bologna/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Apr 2021 15:06:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dinamici.org/2021/04/phd-program-in-mathematics-at-universita-di-bologna/</guid><description>The call for application for the Ph.D. Program in Mathematics (37th cycle - A.Y. 2021/2022) at Università di Bologna is now open. 7 fellowships are available.

Abstract: In this talk I will consider the following question: if one picks a piecewise affine map of the circle &amp;ldquo;at random”, what dynamical behaviour are we likely to observe? The case of standard circle diffeomorphisms has been studied by Herman in the 80s; in this emblematic case the problem can be reduced to theorems close to KAM theory.</description></item><item><title>PhD position at the University of Exeter</title><link>https://www.dinamici.org/2021/04/phd-position-at-the-university-of-exeter/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Apr 2021 08:52:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dinamici.org/2021/04/phd-position-at-the-university-of-exeter/</guid><description>A new PhD position call has been advertised as part of Prof. Mark Hollands&amp;rsquo;s Marie Sklodowska Curie ITN: Early Stage Researcher grant CriticalEarth: Multiscale Critical Transitions in the Earth System at the University of Exeter (UK).

Abstract: We are interested in the limit behaviour of Birkhoff sums over an infinite sigma-finite measure space. If the observable is integrable then &amp;ndash; by a classical theorem by Aaronson &amp;ndash; there exists no sequence of real numbers such that the Birkhoff sum normed by this sequence converges almost surely to 1.</description></item><item><title>RTDb in Mathematical Physics (University of Milano - Bicocca)</title><link>https://www.dinamici.org/2021/04/rtdb-in-mathematical-physics-university-of-milano-bicocca/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Apr 2021 13:31:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dinamici.org/2021/04/rtdb-in-mathematical-physics-university-of-milano-bicocca/</guid><description>A tenure-track assistant professorship (“RTDb” according to the Italian legislation) has been announced at the Department of Mathematics and Applications, University of Milano - Bicocca.

Title: Billiards in subriemannian geometry
Abstract: When one considers manifolds with boundary, billiard dynamics are the natural analogue of standard geodesic dynamics. Namely, instead of having geodesics escape at the boundary, we force them back into the manifold using the reflection law. In other dynamical settings, similar constructions are possible: In 2006, B. Khesin and S. Tabachnikov initiated the study of billiards in the semiriemannian setting, studying the integrability of various tables.</description></item><item><title>RTDb in Probability and Mathematical Statistics (University of Rome Tor Vergata)</title><link>https://www.dinamici.org/2021/03/rtdb-in-probability-and-mathematical-statistics-university-of-rome-tor-vergata/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Mar 2021 13:27:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dinamici.org/2021/03/rtdb-in-probability-and-mathematical-statistics-university-of-rome-tor-vergata/</guid><description>A tenure-track position (Ricercatore Tempo Determinato di tipo b - RTDb) has been announced at the Department of Mathematics, University of Rome Tor Vergata.

Title: The simplest erasing substitution
Abstract: The symbolic action of a substitution on the binary expansion generates naturally an interval map. In case of erasing substitutions, the map is typically Baire-1 and not Darboux. As a model case, we consider what is arguably the simplest erasing substitution, mapping 0s to the empty word and 1s to 0 or 1 depending on the parity.</description></item><item><title>Contributed talks in Dynamical Systems at ICMP 2021, Geneva, August 2021</title><link>https://www.dinamici.org/2021/02/contributed-talks-in-dynamical-systems-at-icmp-2021-geneva-august-2021/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Feb 2021 12:24:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dinamici.org/2021/02/contributed-talks-in-dynamical-systems-at-icmp-2021-geneva-august-2021/</guid><description>The organizers of the Dynamical Systems Thematic Session of the International Congress on Mathematical Physics (2-7 August 2021, Geneva) especially invite young researchers to apply for a contributed talk and/or a poster in the session.

These components, their lifecycles, and their response to external forcing, help us to build a dynamic picture of our ocean.</description></item><item><title>Misha Bialy (Tel Aviv University, Israel)</title><link>https://www.dinamici.org/dai-seminars/mischa-bialy-tel-aviv-university-israel/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Jan 2021 08:29:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dinamici.org/dai-seminars/mischa-bialy-tel-aviv-university-israel/</guid><description>Speaker: **Misha Bialy ** (Tel Aviv University, Israel)
Title: Birkhoff-Poritsky conjecture for centrally-symmetric billiards
Abstract: In this talk I shall discuss Birkhoff-Poritsky conjecture for centrally-symmetric C^2-smooth convex planar billiards. We assume that the domain A between the invariant curve of 4-periodic orbits and the boundary of the phase cylinder is foliated by C^0-invariant curves. Under this assumption we prove that the billiard curve is an ellipse.

Title: Stochastic stability of classical Lorenz flow under impulsive type forcing
Abstract: Inspired by the problem of modeling the so called anthropogenic forcing in climatology, e.g. the effects of the emissions of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, we introduce a novel type of random perturbation for the classical Lorenz flow and prove its stochastic stability. The perturbation acts on the system in an impulsive way, hence is not of diffusive type.</description></item><item><title>PhD position in Groningen</title><link>https://www.dinamici.org/2021/01/phd-position-in-groningen/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Jan 2021 14:35:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dinamici.org/2021/01/phd-position-in-groningen/</guid><description>A new PhD position call has been advertised as part of Marcello Seri&amp;rsquo;s grant on spectral aspects of magnetic fields via sub-Riemannian geometry at the University of Groningen (Netherlands).

Title: Infinite entropy for transcendental entire functions
Abstract: Defining entropy on noncompact metric spaces is a tricky business, since there are several natural and nonequivalent generalizations of the usual notions of entropy for continuous maps on compact spaces. By defining entropy for transcendental maps on the complex plane as the sup over the entropy restricted to compact forward invariant subsets, we prove that with this definition the entropy of such functions is infinite.</description></item><item><title>Isaia Nisoli (Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Brazil)</title><link>https://www.dinamici.org/dai-seminars/isaia-nisoli-universidade-federal-de-rio-de-janeiro-brazil/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Nov 2020 15:00:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dinamici.org/dai-seminars/isaia-nisoli-universidade-federal-de-rio-de-janeiro-brazil/</guid><description>Speaker: Isaia Nisoli (Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Brazil)
Title: A simple system presenting Noise Induced Order
Abstract: In this talk I will present a family of one dimensional systems with random additive noise such that, as the noise size increases, the Lyapunov exponent of the stationary measure transitions from positive to negative. This phenomena is known in literature as Noise Induced Order, and was first observed in a model of the Belosouv-Zhabotinsky reaction and its existence was proven only recently by Galatolo-Monge-Nisoli.</description></item><item><title>Postdoc at Northumbria University Newcastle</title><link>https://www.dinamici.org/2020/11/postdoc-at-northumbria-university-newcastle/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Nov 2020 13:40:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dinamici.org/2020/11/postdoc-at-northumbria-university-newcastle/</guid><description>A 12-month postdoctoral research position in Mathematics is now open within the MCNP (Mathematics of Complex and Nonlinear Phenomena) group in the Department of Mathematics, Physics and Electrical Engineering Northumbria University Newcastle.

Title: Locating Ruelle-Pollicott resonances
Abstract: We study the spectrum of transfer operators associated to various dynamical systems. Our aim is to obtain precise information on discrete spectrum. To this end we propose a unitary approach. We consider various settings where new information can be obtained following different branches along the proposed path. These settings include affine expanding Markov maps, uniformly expanding Markov maps, non-uniformly expanding maps, hyperbolic diffeomorphisms.</description></item><item><title>PhD position in Bremen</title><link>https://www.dinamici.org/2020/11/phd-position-in-bremen/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Nov 2020 18:00:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dinamici.org/2020/11/phd-position-in-bremen/</guid><description>Prof. Anke Paul at the University of Bremen advertises a position for a doctoral researcher (a.k.a.

Title: Chaotic motion in the breathing circle billiard
Abstract: We consider the free motion of a point particle inside a circular billiard with periodically moving boundary, with the assumption that the collisions of the particle with the boundary are elastic so that the energy of the particle is not preserved. It is known that if the motion of the boundary is regular enough then the energy is bounded due to the existence of invariant curves.</description></item><item><title>Postdocs in Bologna</title><link>https://www.dinamici.org/2020/10/postdocs-in-bologna-3/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Oct 2020 13:25:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dinamici.org/2020/10/postdocs-in-bologna-3/</guid><description>The Department of Mathematics of Università di Bologna has opened a call for two 1-year postdoctoral positions denominated “Starting postdoctoral position in Mathematics and Applications in Sciences, Social Sciences and Engineering”.

Abstract: It is well known that the integral of an observable is preserved by induction. We are interested here in extensions of this result to moments of order 2 and 3. We have two natural candidates for the second and third order moments: the classical asymptotic variance (given by the Green-Kubo formula) and an analogous quantity of the third order.</description></item><item><title>Andreas Knauf (Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg, Germany)</title><link>https://www.dinamici.org/dai-seminars/andreas-knauf-friedrich-alexander-universitat-erlangen-nurnberg-germany/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jun 2020 07:07:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dinamici.org/dai-seminars/andreas-knauf-friedrich-alexander-universitat-erlangen-nurnberg-germany/</guid><description>Speaker: Andreas Knauf (Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg, Germany)
Title: Asymptotic velocity for scattering particles
Abstract: Partly with Jacques Fejoz, Richard Montgomery, Stefan Fleischer and Manuel Quaschner.
The past and future of scattering particle systems is partly determined by their asymptotic velocity, that is, the Cesàro limit of the velocity. That this exists for bounded interactions and all initial conditions, is part of a statement sometimes called &amp;lsquo;asymptotic completeness&amp;rsquo;. The same statement does not apply to individual initial conditions in celestial mechanics.</description></item><item><title>Seminar by Marta Maggioni postponed to July 1</title><link>https://www.dinamici.org/dai-seminars/seminar-by-marta-maggioni-universiteit-leiden-netherlands-postponed-to-july-1/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jun 2020 08:34:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dinamici.org/dai-seminars/seminar-by-marta-maggioni-universiteit-leiden-netherlands-postponed-to-july-1/</guid><description>The DinAmicI, in solidarity with the #Strike4BlackLives and #ShutDownSTEM movements on June 10, 2020, acknowledge the racism present throughout academia and especially in STEM subjects.

Title: The topology and geometry of random square-tiled surfaces
Abstract: A square-tiled surface (STS) is a branched cover of the standard square torus with branching over exactly one point. They are concrete examples of translation surfaces which are an important class of singular flat metrics on 2-manifolds with applications in Teichmüller theory and polygonal billiards. In this talk we will consider a randomizing model for STSs based on permutation pairs and use it to compute the genus distribution.</description></item><item><title>May-12 online event: Celebrating Women in Math (9 June 2020, 15:00)</title><link>https://www.dinamici.org/2020/05/may-12-online-event-celebrating-women-in-math-9-june-2020-1500/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 May 2020 10:16:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dinamici.org/2020/05/may-12-online-event-celebrating-women-in-math-9-june-2020-1500/</guid><description>The Department of Mathematics of University of Rome Tor Vergata invites you to attend the following event, organized as part of the international project &amp;ldquo;May 12&amp;rdquo; (https://may12.womeninmaths.org/).

Title: Matching for random systems with an application to minimal weight expansions
Abstract: We consider families of skew-product maps, representing systems evolving in discrete time in which, at each time step, one of a number of transformations is chosen according to an i.i.d process and applied. We extend the notion of matching for such dynamical systems and we show that, for a certain family of piecewise affine random maps of the interval, the property of random matching implies that any invariant density is piecewise constant.</description></item><item><title>Recruitment in Ergodic Theory &amp; Dynamical Systems at University of Warwick</title><link>https://www.dinamici.org/2020/05/recruitment-in-ergodic-theory-dynamical-systems-at-university-of-warwick/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 May 2020 07:15:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dinamici.org/2020/05/recruitment-in-ergodic-theory-dynamical-systems-at-university-of-warwick/</guid><description>Prof. Mark Pollicott (University of Warwick) advertises the following positions in the area of Ergodic theory and Dynamical Systems:

Title: Rational Horocycle lifts and the tails of Quadratic Weyl sums
Abstract: Equidistribution of horocycles on hyperbolic surfaces has been used to dynamically answer several probabilistic questions about number-theoretical objects. In this talk we focus on horocycle lifts, i.e. curves on higher-dimensional manifolds whose projection to the hyperbolic surface is a classical horocycle, and their behaviour under the action of the geodesic flow. It is known that when such horocycle lifts are `generic’, then their push forward via the geodesic flow becomes equidistributed in the ambient manifold.</description></item><item><title>Martin Leguil (Université Paris-Sud 11, France)</title><link>https://www.dinamici.org/dai-seminars/martin-leguil-universite-paris-sud-11-france/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 May 2020 12:20:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dinamici.org/dai-seminars/martin-leguil-universite-paris-sud-11-france/</guid><description>Speaker: Martin Leguil (Université Paris-Sud 11, France)
Title: Some rigidity results for billiards and hyperbolic flows
Abstract: In a project with P. Bálint, J. De Simoi and V. Kaloshin, we have been studying the inverse problem for a class of open dispersing billiards obtained by removing from the plane a finite number of smooth strictly convex scatterers satisfying a non-eclipse condition. The dynamics of such billiards is hyperbolic (Axiom A), and there is a natural labeling of periodic orbits.</description></item><item><title>Giulio Tiozzo (University of Toronto, Canada)</title><link>https://www.dinamici.org/dai-seminars/giulio-tiozzo-university-of-toronto-canada/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 May 2020 12:18:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dinamici.org/dai-seminars/giulio-tiozzo-university-of-toronto-canada/</guid><description>Speaker: Giulio Tiozzo (University of Toronto, Canada)
Title: Central limit theorems for counting measures in coarse negative curvature
Abstract: We establish general central limit theorems for an action of a group on a hyperbolic space with respect to counting for the word length in the group.
In 2013, Chas, Li, and Maskit produced numerical experiments on random closed geodesics on a hyperbolic pair of pants. Namely, they drew uniformly at random conjugacy classes of a given word length, and considered the hyperbolic length of the corresponding closed geodesic on the pair of pants.</description></item><item><title>The Brin Prize 2020 awarded to Corinna Ulcigrai!</title><link>https://www.dinamici.org/2020/04/the-brin-prize-2020-to-corinna-ulcigrai/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Apr 2020 12:52:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dinamici.org/2020/04/the-brin-prize-2020-to-corinna-ulcigrai/</guid><description>The ninth Brin Prize in Dynamical Systems has been awarded to our own

*Title: ***Rare Events in Dynamical Systems via Transfer Operator Techniques
Supervisor: Wael Bahsoun (W.Bahsoun@lboro.ac.uk; phone +44-15-09-222883).
Nature of work: Theory
Area: Mathematics: Ergodic Theory and Dynamical Systems
Brief description: The study of rare events in dynamical systems is currently one of the most active branches of research in ergodic theory. In part, this is due to their interesting applications in earth and ocean sciences. An example of a rare event in dynamical systems appears in the study of ‘open’ systems where orbits infrequently escape from the domain, typically by falling into a small “hole” in the phase space.</description></item><item><title>8 Postdocs (including Dynamics) in São Paulo</title><link>https://www.dinamici.org/2017/12/8-postdocs-including-dynamics-in-sao-paulo/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Dec 2017 18:00:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dinamici.org/2017/12/8-postdocs-including-dynamics-in-sao-paulo/</guid><description>Postdoctoral positions at the University of São Paulo, Brazil

&amp;ldquo;A geometric model for the natural extension of continued fraction maps&amp;rdquo;
Abstract: Just as classical &amp;ldquo;Floor&amp;rdquo; continued fractions induce the Gauss map on the real unit interval, other euclidean division algorithms (Ceiling, Even, Odd, NearestInteger, &amp;hellip;) induce piecewise-fractional maps with integer coefficients. All these maps have natural extensions that can easily be described on an ad hoc basis.
We present a general framework for dealing with all these maps in a uniform way.</description></item><item><title>Prima Giornata DinAmica - 25 November 2016</title><link>https://www.dinamici.org/2016/09/prima-giornata-dinamica-25-novembre-2016/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Sep 2016 07:46:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dinamici.org/2016/09/prima-giornata-dinamica-25-novembre-2016/</guid><description>This is a call for the participation of all DinAmicI to the Prima Giornata DinAmica, our first social meeting to be held on 25 November at the Gran Sasso Science Institute in L&amp;rsquo;Aquila.

&amp;ldquo;Ergodicity and Partial Hyperbolicity on Unit Tangent Bundles of Sufaces&amp;rdquo;
Abstract: A diffeomorphism is partially hyperbolic if the tangent bundle of the ambient manifold splits into three invariant sub-bundles, \(TM = E_s \oplus E_c \oplus E_u\), in such a way that \(df\) contracts the vectors of \(E_s\) and expands the vectors of \(E_u\) while the vectors of \(E_c\) have an intermediate behavior. We will present some new advances in the study of the ergodicity of volume preserving partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms acting on the unit tangent bundle of hyperbolic surfaces.</description></item><item><title>Colloquium at Tor Vergata: Walter Craig (McMaster University) 12 Sept 2016</title><link>https://www.dinamici.org/2016/09/colloquium-walter-craig-mcmaster-university-12-sept-2016/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Sep 2016 15:40:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dinamici.org/2016/09/colloquium-walter-craig-mcmaster-university-12-sept-2016/</guid><description>DEPARTMENT COLLOQUIUM

&amp;ldquo;Ergodicity of Surface Actions via Flag Manifold&amp;rdquo;
Abstract: This talk is devoted to study the ergodicity of smooth surface actions. We provide a sufficient condition for surface actions to be ergodic with respect to the Lebesgue measure. First, we address the main results obtained so far for the unit circle, as a main tool in higher dimensional. After that, by introducing the notion of flag manifold, we explain how rich minimality of sufficiently smooth action on the flag manifold may lead to the ergodicity of the initial action.</description></item><item><title>Senior postdoc position in Bologna</title><link>https://www.dinamici.org/2016/08/senior-postdoc-position-in-bologna/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Aug 2016 09:34:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dinamici.org/2016/08/senior-postdoc-position-in-bologna/</guid><description>The Department of Mathematics of Università di Bologna has opened a call for a 1+1-year postdoctoral position denominated &amp;ldquo;Advanced postdoctoral position in Mathematics and Applications in Sciences, Social Sciences and Engineering&amp;rdquo;.

“Families of hyperbolic Hamiltonian tori”
Thursday 11 February 2016, 15.00
Dipartimento di Matematica (aula Dal Passo) Università di Roma “Tor Vergata”
Abstract:
In integrable Hamiltonian systems hyperbolic tori form families, parametrised by the actions conjugate to the toral angles. The union over such a family is a normally hyperbolic invariant manifold. Under Diophantine conditions a hyperbolic torus persists a small perturbation away from integrability. Locally around such a torus the normally hyperbolic invariant manifold is the centre manifold of that torus and persists as well.</description></item><item><title>Dynamical systems in logic, complex analysis and ergodic theory</title><link>https://www.dinamici.org/2016/02/dynamical-systems-in-logic-complex-analysis-and-ergodic-theory/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Feb 2016 16:44:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dinamici.org/2016/02/dynamical-systems-in-logic-complex-analysis-and-ergodic-theory/</guid><description>The workshop &amp;ldquo;Dynamical systems in logic, complex analysis and ergodic theory&amp;rdquo; will be held in Pisa, from February 8 until 9, 2016.

Abstract: For non-uniformly expanding maps inducing w.r.t. a general (i.e., not necessarily first) return time to Gibbs Markov maps, we provide sufficient conditions for obtaining sharp estimates for the correlation function. This applies to both the finite and the infinite measure setting.</description></item><item><title>Sorrentino's seminar in Pisa</title><link>https://www.dinamici.org/2015/10/sorrentinos-seminar-in-pisa/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Oct 2015 10:47:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dinamici.org/2015/10/sorrentinos-seminar-in-pisa/</guid><description>Monday 9th November 2015, h 15:00 - 17:00 Aula Seminari (Dipartimento di Matematica, Pisa)

What: Seminar &amp;ldquo;Recent progress towards Sarnak’s and Chowla’s Conjectures&amp;rdquo;
Abstract: I will present an overview of Sarnak’s conjecture on the disjointness of the Möbius function from any deterministic sequence and the related Chowla’s conjecture on the self-correlations of the Möbius function. Some progress towards weaker versions of these conjectures have been made recently, and I plan to illustrate them.</description></item><item><title>De Simoi's seminar in Pisa</title><link>https://www.dinamici.org/2015/07/de-simois-seminar-in-pisa/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jul 2015 08:46:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dinamici.org/2015/07/de-simois-seminar-in-pisa/</guid><description>Monday 20/7/2015, h 11:30-12:30 Sala Conferenze (Puteano, Centro De Giorgi)

&amp;ldquo;AN INTEGRABLE BILLIARD CLOSE TO AN ELLIPSE OF SMALL ECCENTRICITY IS AN ELLIPSE&amp;rdquo;
Abstract: In 1927 G. Birkhoff conjectured that if a billiard in a strictly convex smooth domain is integrable, the domain has to be an ellipse (or a circle). The conjecture is still wide open, and presents remarkable relations with open questions in inverse spectral theory and spectral rigidity.</description></item><item><title>How to add a new publication</title><link>https://www.dinamici.org/2015/07/how-to-add-a-new-publication/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jul 2015 21:08:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dinamici.org/2015/07/how-to-add-a-new-publication/</guid><description>Keeping an up-to-date list of publications on our site is important in terms of our visibility as DinAmicI.
